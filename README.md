Some basic Python scripts which uses scikit-learn and some other libraries to do some classification based on training data provided.

MachineLearning#1: Decision Tree Classification with small list data.<br />
MachineLearning#2: Decision Tree Classification with iris dataset.<br />
MachineLearning#3: Histogram generation on data provided.<br />
MachineLearning#4: Accuracy test between decision tree and KNeighbours classifiers.<br />
MachineLearning#5: Basic classifier based on euclideon distance.<br />
