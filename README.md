Some basic Python scripts which uses scikit-learn and some other libraries to do some classification based on training data provided.

MachineLearning#1: Decision Tree Classification with small list data
MachineLearning#2: Decision Tree Classification with iris dataset
MachineLearning#3: Histogram generation on data provided
MachineLearning#4: Accuracy test between decision tree and KNeighbours classifiers 
MachineLearning#5: Basic classifier based on euclideon distance

--- This all scripts where written for practice ---
